**Inspiration**<br />
Our project, Magic Seeds, is inspired by the need to make plant care easier and more accessible, especially for individuals who love gardening but struggle to keep track of plant care schedules. We wanted to create a platform where users can effortlessly manage their plants and receive reminders for watering and other needs, using text notifications powered by the MagicLoops API.

**What it does**<br />
Magic Seeds is a web-based platform that allows users to add their plants, set custom watering schedules, and receive reminders when it's time to water their plants. Users can also view and edit their plant details, manage their account through a profile popup, and access real-time plant care information.

**Why?**<br />
We built this tool because we noticed that busy schedules often make it difficult for plant enthusiasts to take proper care of their indoor and outdoor plants. By providing reminders and a simple management system, we aim to help users maintain healthier plants and avoid forgetting to water them.

**How we built it**<br />
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the front end of Magic Seeds. The design features intuitive plus buttons for adding new plants and popups for inputting details like plant type, nickname, and watering schedules. While our original plan included integration with MagicLoops for sending SMS reminders, we faced limitations in accessing reliable resources for implementing their API. Despite this, we succeeded in outlining the framework for future integration and showcasing how reminders could improve the user experience.

**Challenges we ran into**<br />
The biggest challenge we faced was implementing MagicLoops. Due to limited documentation and lack of online resources, we couldn't fully integrate the SMS reminder functionality as planned. Additionally, managing plant data efficiently and providing a smooth user experience for adding and editing plant details posed some technical hurdles.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**<br />
We are proud of the clear structure and user-friendly interface of Magic Seeds, allowing users to add and manage plants effortlessly. Even though we couldn't implement MagicLoops for sending text reminders, we created a solid foundation for future integration and demonstrated how the concept would work. We also successfully implemented dynamic popups, random plant images, and user authentication features.

**What we learned**<br />
We learned that while integrating third-party APIs can greatly enhance the functionality of a project, it's essential to plan for potential setbacks like limited documentation or technical difficulties. The experience taught us to be flexible and focus on delivering the core functionality even when some features may not be fully implemented. It also reinforced the importance of building modular and scalable code.

**What's next for Magic Seeds?**<br />
The next steps for Magic Seeds involve fully integrating MagicLoops once more resources become available and enhancing the profile feature to provide deeper analytics on plant care habits. We also plan to introduce more advanced notifications, such as email alerts, and potentially partner with other APIs for gardening tips and real-time weather data to further personalize the user experience.
